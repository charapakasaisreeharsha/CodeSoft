# Task-1
## Objective
> The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, etc.
We aim to achieve this by using a decision tree classifier and optimizing its performance through hyperparameter tuning.
## Result
> Through systematic preprocessing, model building, and hyperparameter tuning, i have successfully developed a decision tree classifier that achieves 82% accuracy in 
predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. This demonstrates effective handling of both numerical and categorical data.

# Task-4
## Objective
> Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that
customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as
advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and
advertising platform selection.
## Result
> Through systematic preprocessing, model building, and evaluation, I have successfully developed a linear regression model that provides a reasonable prediction of movie ratings. The model's performance metrics demonstrate its 92% effectiveness in handling both numerical and categorical data to predict movie ratings accurately.

# Task-5
## Objective
> The goal is to build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions effectively. Using a DecisionTreeClassifier or any classification Algorithm.
## Result
> Through systematic preprocessing, model building, and evaluation, I addressed class imbalance with SMOTE and achieved a 99% accuracy. The model was trained on resampled data and evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The high accuracy indicates a robust performance in identifying fraud.
