#Task-1
**Objective**
The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, etc. We aim to achieve this by using a decision tree classifier and optimizing its performance through hyperparameter tuning.
Through systematic preprocessing, model building, and hyperparameter tuning, you successfully developed a decision tree classifier that achieves 82% accuracy in predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. This demonstrates effective handling of both numerical and categorical data.
